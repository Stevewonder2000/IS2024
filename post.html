                        <h2 class="section-heading">Preloved</h2>
                        <p>This is my all time favorite place to thrift, but I may be biast because I worked here. But really I think you do get the most bag for your buck. It is a family run bussiness and the heart of the bussiness is really the customers and the seller that book the booths and provide the cloths.</p>
                        <p>The booth owners set their own price on the clothing in each booth so prices and quality varies. I have been able to frind some great deals here on name brand cloths especially on discount days. Discount days are Tuesday through Friday. Friday has the best discounts, but I also like to go Saturdays to get first pick at the newly stocked booths. New Booth bookers rotate through every week.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Uptown Cheapskate</h2>
                        <p>I'd say Uptown has similar quality to Preloved if not a little bit better. People bring their cloths to the store and they go through and choose what they will buy from you to then resell. Everything is definently marked up in price compared to Preloved, but you are garunteed to find lots of good brands and styles. They also have discounts on certain color tagged items.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Plato's Closet</h2>
                        <p>This palce is similar to Uptown in how the bussiness in run, but personally I feel like I have been able to find better deals here. You may have to hunt a little bit more simplu because they have a lot more stuff. They also seem to have a but more variety of stuff which I personaly an fond of.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Savers</h2>
                        <p>If you are looking for somewhere with more of a traditional thrift shopping feel I'd go to savers. You can find really good deals here but you will have to hunt. I would'nt necassarily advice going here if you are looking for something specific. However I would advice coming here over Desseret Industries, personally, I have found better deals on cloths.
